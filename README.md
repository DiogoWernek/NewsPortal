<h1>🚀 Tech News: My Tech News Portal 🖥️</h1>

Tech News is an app I developed to test and improve my skills with CSS Grid. 🧑‍💻

The goal was to create a tech news portal with a modern, responsive layout. It was a great opportunity to apply Grid Layout concepts and enhance my skills in responsiveness and UI design.

This project was part of a practical challenge from <a href="https://www.rocketseat.com.br/" target="_blank">Rocketseat</a>, where I dove deep into frontend best practices. It was not only a valuable learning experience but also fun to build something that reflects my passion for technology and innovation!

💡 Tip: If you're looking to master CSS Grid, I highly recommend doing practical projects like this one. There's no better way to learn than by building real-world applications.
